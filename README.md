# mastermind-reach

 This is my immplementation of the mastermind game. It has been very fun to make, and I look forward to enhancing it. It is fully functional, but note that in order to run, when you insert the numbers via the /play route, the feedback will come via the terminal. I really wanted to create a web socket server to avoid continous api calls (they restart the process) but unfortunately I ran out of time. 

 To start: run npm run build.
